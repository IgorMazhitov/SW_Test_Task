# Domain-Driven Design Architecture for NestJS Backend

## Overview

This document explains the domain-driven design (DDD) architecture implemented in our NestJS backend application. The architecture promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and better code organization.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Domain Layer

**Location**: `/src/domain/`

The domain layer is the core of the application and contains:

- **Entities**: Business objects that represent the domain model
- **Interfaces**: Core business interfaces and types

This layer should have minimal dependencies on external frameworks. It should contain pure business logic and rules.

### 2. Application Layer

**Location**: `/src/application/`

The application layer coordinates the application's tasks and delegates work to domain objects. It contains:

- **Modules**: Feature modules organized by business domain
- **Services**: Application-specific business logic
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API communication
- **Helpers**: Helper services used across modules
- **Abstracts**: Abstract classes and base implementations

This layer depends on the domain layer but not on infrastructure or interface layers.

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

**Location**: `/src/infrastructure/`

The infrastructure layer provides implementations for interfacing with external systems:

- **Database**: Database-specific code, repositories, and migrations
- **External Services**: Integration with external APIs and services

This layer depends on both the domain and application layers.

### 4. Shared Layer

**Location**: `/src/shared/`

The shared layer contains cross-cutting concerns that can be used by all layers:

- **Guards**: Authentication and authorization guards
- **Interceptors**: Request/response interceptors
- **Pipes**: Data transformation pipes
- **Decorators**: Custom decorators
- **Utilities**: Shared utility functions

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Business logic is isolated from infrastructure concerns
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect other layers
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Flexibility**: Implementation details can be changed without affecting business logic

## Coding Guidelines

1. **Dependencies**: Dependencies should always point inward (domain ← application ← infrastructure)
2. **Domain Isolation**: Domain layer should be completely isolated from external frameworks
3. **Thin Controllers**: Controllers should only handle HTTP requests and delegate to services
4. **Service Responsibility**: Services should orchestrate business operations but not contain business rules
5. **Repository Pattern**: Use repositories to abstract data access
6. **Entity Encapsulation**: Entities should encapsulate their behavior and validate their state

## Import Practices

- Use absolute imports for cross-layer dependencies
- Use relative imports for intra-layer dependencies
- Create barrel files (`index.ts`) to simplify imports
- Avoid circular dependencies
